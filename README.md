# If Statements â€“ Teaching Python to Think!

Today, I learned how to teach my code to make decisions like I do using **if statements**.

---

## I Learned:

- How to use `if`, `else`, and `elif`
- How to check if numbers are greater, less, or equal
- How to use user input with decisions

---

## What I Practiced:

- Checking if someone is old enough to drive or vote
- Identifying positive, negative, or zero numbers
- YES or NO game
- Odd or Even number checker

---

## Portfolio Project:

I created a **Smart Age Assistant** that tells users:
- If they can drive
- If they can vote
- If they can watch PG-18 movies

## Files:

- `if_statements_and_decisions.ipynb`
- `README.md`
